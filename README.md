# Dataquest Guided Project: Predicting House Sale Prices
*This is a Guided Project I completed for the Data Analyst/Data Science path on Dataquest. Dataquest does provide solution code that is available while completing this project. As a result, I do not claim that all of this code is mine or original. At times when I got stuck or when my code didn't fit the direction of the guided analysis, I matched their code for the sake of completing the exercise and learning the structure of the analysis.
So while the code is not 100% original or unique, I believe one of the strengths of these projects is that it helps students like me identify business problems where analysis like this can be valuable. As a result, I'm confident that I can adapt this particular analysis to similar business problems I may face in my day-to-day work.*

## Introduction

### Methods Used
- data processing/cleaning
- feature engineering/selection
- linear regression

### Technologies Used
- Python
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
        - LinearRegression
        - Mean Squared Error
        
## Next Steps
That's it for the guided steps. Here's some potenial next steps that you can take:

- Continue iteration on feature engineering:
    - Reserach some other approaches to feature engineering online around housing data.
    - Visit the Kaggle kernels page for this dataset to see approaches others took.
- Improve your feature selection:
    - Research ways of doing feature selection better with categorical columns (something we didn't cover in this particular course).
